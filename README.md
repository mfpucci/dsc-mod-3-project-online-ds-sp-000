This project aims to gather insights from a large grocery chain worldwide on its sales and discounting data.  The full code can be viewed in the Northwind Database Analysis.ipynb.
The main questions this analysis looks to answer are:
  1. Does discount amount have statistically significant effect on quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what levels?
  2. Do certain products in different categories get discounted more than others?
  3. Is there a statistically significant difference in the amount of sales with discounts originated from the United States or United Kingdom?
  4. Is there a statistically significant difference in discounts given by employees of different titles?Â¶
